# Zui's vJokers
A Balatro mod featuring VTubers, by a VTuber

What if VTubers become Balatro jokers?

# About the Author

Heya, I'm Zui, I'm a VTuber and a language blogger.

This mod is my first modding project, started out of fun to learn Lua and pixel art styles. I've shared some progress on my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/zuilusive) streams, and some assets on my [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/zui-lusive.bsky.social) and [Twitter](https://x.com/ZuiLusiVe)!

Check out my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/zuilusive), where I stream indie games, roguelikes, and roguelites, and occasionally talk about languages and linguistics

### Next Goal

> 15 new vJokers based on Indie VTubers and Hololive VTubers
